# Cookbase
A platform to validate, store and manage cooking recipes based on the JSON Cookbase Format.

Cookbase proposes and implements a data model striving for an *as-complete-as-possible* data structure applied to cooking data. A new suite of data formats (the [**Cookbase Recipe Standard Format**]) and a consistent data model structure with its database architecture and recipe data analysis tools are included in the Cookbase project.

Please check out the [documentation](http://landarltracker.com/cookbase/docs/index.html) for detailed information about the project and the available API.

## Install

Cookbase can be installed through the PyPI repository using the following command:

```console
pip3 install cookbase
```
